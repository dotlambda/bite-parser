There are still various areas where bite-parser is in need of improvement or
extension. Look at the `GitHub
issues <https://github.com/jgosmann/bite-parser/issues>`_ for a not necessarily
complete list.

Currently, development on bite-parser is not my main focus, but I welcome
contributions; ideally in the form of a pull request on GitHub. Please allow
me some time to react. For larger changes or more fundamental changes, it
might be best to discuss these changes as part of an issue or discussion before
putting a lot of effort into them.
